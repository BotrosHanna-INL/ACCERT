## A Tool to Quantify Capital Cost Reduction Pathways for Advanced Nuclear Reactors
- This is a Python tool that estimated the impact of several variables on the capital cost of the nuclear reactors.
- The methodology and assumptions behind this tool are explained in detail in this report:  https://inldigitallibrary.inl.gov/sites/sti/sti/Sort_109810.pdf
- Another excel tool for the cost reduction can be found here: https://fuelcycleoptions.inl.gov/Shared%20Documents/Nuclear-Reactor-Capital-Cost-Reduction-Pathway-Tool.pdf
- This tool includes the following files
	1. "CostReduction_exploration_mode.ipynb": a file that demonstrated how the capital cost (structured as a code of account) will change step by step due to each single variable
	2. "src.py: a file that includes some Python functions that are not included in the main file. Most users will not need to look at this file.
	3. "sensitivity_analysis.ipynb": This file demonstrates examples of sensitivity analysis.
