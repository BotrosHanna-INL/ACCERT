Level 3
=======

*   Level 3:

    *   This is a level lower than level 2. Within this level will be different cost elements that make up the total cost of the level 2 it follows.
    *   The COA for this level will be the same three digit numbers as the level 2 that precedes it followed by different letters or numbers based on the interation.
    *   In most cost elements, this is the lowest level of breakdown.

        *   For example, if the cost element is the first cost element in level 2, the code would be written as l3COA(211A) or l3COA(211B) for the second.
        *   Refer to the database to see which cost element refers to what.

**All the cost elements and their descriptions are broken down in the cost elements and COA tabs.**
