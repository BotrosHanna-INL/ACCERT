About ACCERT
============

The main function of the Algorithm for the Capital Cost Estimation of Reactor Technologies (ACCERT) is to provide an item-by-item estimate of the cost of a facility, primarily nuclear power stations. The core of ACCERT is the large number of algorithms that have been developed and will continue to be developed. ACCERT is also a general methodology for identifying and organizing the individual items that are estimated using the ACCERT algorithms. ACCERT can also summarize status and results, save results and pull information from previous analyses, and provide an interactive dynamic graphical user interface for a wide range of functions and visualizations.

At its core, ACCERT should comprise of three major components:

*  Relational Database

      *	Creation, editing and linking of different element types
      *	Report generation (queries)
      *	Search of different cost elements

*  Equation solvers (extraction of information from elements and evaluation/updating of fields in the database)

      *	Algorithms
      *	Escalation or inflation
      *	Cost aggregation, or the sum of the lower-level components

*  Interactive Graphical User Interface

      *	Dynamic Windows
