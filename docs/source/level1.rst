Level 1
=======

*   Level 1:

    *   This is a level lower than level 0. Within this level will be different cost elements that make up the total cost of level 0.
    *   The COA for this level will be a two digit number with the first digit being the same as the number that precedes it followed by the iteration of the cost element.

        *   For example, if the cost element is the first cost element in level 1, the code would be written as l1COA(21) or l1COA(22) for the second.

.. admonition:: NOTICE!

    **All the cost elements and their descriptions are broken down in the "Cost Elements and Code of Accounts" tab.**
