ACCERT Inputs and Explanations
==============================

The Algorithm for the Capital Cost Elements of Reactor Technologies (ACCERT) relies on several different references to properly calculate the cost of a nuclear facility.

This stage of ACCERT bases the calculations off of two user inputs:

*       A reference model. (Between the PWR12-BE or the ABR-1000) 
*       The theoretical thermal and electrical output of the desired nuclear reactor. (MW)
