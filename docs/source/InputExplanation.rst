Inputs of ACCERT
================

In ACCERT there are several different user inputs. For each user input, there is a lot of different variables that can have their values changed.

**NOTE: the ID in each node using the string format can only contain letters, numbers and underscores. If the ID does not start with a letter, it will be considered a number even if it has letters in it. Use quotes to avoid this error.**

Below are the commands that can have their variables changed, as well as the variables within them that can be changed.
