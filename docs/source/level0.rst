Level 0
=======

*   Level 0:

    *   The highest level of the cost element breakdown. This level is the total cost of a certian aspect of the reactor.
    *   The Code Of Account (COA) for this level will be a single digit number. For example, 2. This would be denoted by l0COA(2).

        *   This could also be written as l0COA(2C), this just the calculation before the total cost.

.. admonition:: NOTICE!

    **All the cost elements and their descriptions are broken down in the "Cost Elements and Code of Accounts" tab.**
